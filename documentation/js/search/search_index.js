source repository and consequently anyone with access to the repository is more than invited to collaborate in the project.\nThere are 2 main ways to collaborate in the process:\n\nCreating a new client.\n\nUpdating any of the already available clients.\n\n\nLet's see how to proceed in each one of this situations.\nCreating a new client\nWe have integrated angular-cli as a way to boost the process of creating new service for the clients. It is important to note that although the process is highly accelerated, there is still work to do for the new API client creator to make it fully functional.\nTo create a new API client template, please follow the next steps:\n\nCreating a new branch in your local repository:\n\ngit checkout -b feat/the-name-of-your-branch\nRun the follwoing command to the generation of a new service in angular:\n\nng generate service my-new-service\nGenerate code in the generated files\n\nUpdating any of the already available clients\nTo fix any issue or implement a new feature in any of the already existent API clients, please follow the next steps:\n\nCreate a new branch for the new code:\n\ngit checkout -b feat-or-fix-or-chore-depending-on-the-update/the-name-of-your-branch\nMake your changes to the code base.\n\nOnce you have finished including your changes, please follow the guidelines to contribute your changes according to section Contributing code to the repository.\nContributing code to the repository\nTo contribute your code to the repositiry, please follow the next steps:\n\nOnce you are happy with your code, stash your changes into your branch:\n\ngit add .\nCreate a new commit executing the following command from the root of your local repository:\n\ngit commit -m \"comentary of commit\"\nPush your branch to the remote repository (this step will run the unit tests of all the packages and it will not let you continue until of all them pass):\n\ngit push origin feat-or-fix-or-chore-depending-on-the-update/the-name-of-your-branch\nFrom Github, send a new pull request from the branch with your code to master.\n\nAsk for revision from any of the main contributors of the project.\n\nOnce the code has been reviewed and accepted, merge your code into master.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
